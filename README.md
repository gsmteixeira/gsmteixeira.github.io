# GabrielPageV2

Single-page academic landing page / portfolio for **Gabriel Teixeira** (PhD candidate), built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS v3**, and using **Chakra UI** for layout primitives (while styling is handled mainly by Tailwind classes).

The website is structured as a one-page portfolio with smooth navigation across sections (Begin, About, Research, Publications, Talks, Projects, Contact), plus a modern background composition using abstract shapes.
